1. Introduction

First of all thanks for downloading and using LTE Game Engine 2.2 SDK version,
this engine is based on Irrlicht 1.0 and almost all of Irrlicht functions are
supported here.

2. Requirements
===========================================================================


To use the LTE Game Engine you must have Toolchains installed, if you are running
under win32 you can find the downloadable compiled version here:

PSPGL is included in this archive, you need to use this version of PSPGL because
i've fixed some bugs in it.


===========================================================================
3. Some suggestions
===========================================================================

This engine has no limitations except of hardware limitations, you have to
remember that you are programming on PSP and it has got only 24MB of free
memory for homebrews. So, if I can give you some suggestions use mipmapped
textures, don't use meshes that has got 30000 vertices, etc..


===========================================================================
4. How to start
===========================================================================

Just run the Makefile contained in the same directory of this file, and
include files and libraries will be installed in your computer.

You can find documented examples in this archive that will explain you the basic
of this engine. For any question please go to the LTE Game Engine forum at:

http://www.ltestudios.com/forum

To run examples you have to extract the media.zip in your ms0:/ folder, 
just compile the example doing 'make' or 'make kxploit'.

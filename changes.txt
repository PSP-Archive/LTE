---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ Current version 2.2 ]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
- Fixed IReadFile and IWriteFile to work with relative paths

- Added the method IVideoDriver::draw2DStretchedImage to draw stretched images.

- Added the method IAudioSound::setAutoStop(ms) to automatically stop the sound after
  ms milliseconds
 
- Important fixes in the audio driver

- added getAbsoluteClippingRect to get the clipping rect in gui elements

- Added custom bones for Direct X meshes

- Added GUI progressbar


Changes in version 2.1a
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added the flag EMF_DISABLEFLUSH, enable this to get faster speed (Maybe).


Changes in version 2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changed the entrypoint of a program from main() to int engineMain(int argc, void *argv)

- Added the Network driver that can be used to manage wifi and sockets.

- Added Planar Shadows, a very fast kind of shadows.

- Added two function to trace the texture cache, IVideoDriver::getTextureByIndex and
  IVideoDriver::getTextureCount
  
- Added the core::stringb class for manage binary strings and received data from sockets.

- Fixed a bug in the virtual keyboard

- Small bug fixes

Changes in version 2.0f
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some fixes in the audio driver. Thanks to Nyxojaele for helping me finding and
  solving this bug.

Changes in version 2.0e
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
- Possibility to disable the mouse control while the cursor is still visible, by doing
  getCursorControl()->setEnabled(false);

- Possibility to enable or disable the cross button for the mouse control doing
  getCursorControl()->setXEnabled(false/true) (mouse is still moveable, to stop moving
  use setEnabled)

Changes in version 2.0d
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Now it's possible to use GL_LESS instead of GL_LEQUAL depth func of a scene node doing
  node->setMaterialFlag(video::EMF_DEPTHLESS, true);

Changes in version 2.0c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Now the MOUSEMOVE Event is called correctly

- Possibiliy to change the speed of the cursor doing SceneManager->getCursorControl()->setSpeed(x),
  the default value is 100.

- Fixed the intersectWith method for 2d lines

- The clipping routine needs to run faster a buffer that is set to 1MB, if you don't want to use
  this feature do driver->enableClippingFeature ( false ); to get this memory. As default
  the clipping routine is enabled.

- Renamed the flag EMF_STATIC_MESH into EMF_DMA. This flag can be set for a node using 
  node->setMaterialFlag(video::EMF_DMA, true). If you enable this flag the mesh buffer will be
  send directly to the GPU. Note that if you use it for animated meshes used in multiple nodes
  you will get weird results.

- Now it's possible to use EMF_DMA for MD2 Animated Meshes also if used in multiple nodes.

- AT3 audio play speed improvement.


Changes in version 2.0b
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug causing terrains rendering slow


Changes in version 2.0a
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved the speed of the clipping routine.

- Added EMF_STATIC_MESH material flag, if your mesh is static and doesn't need clipping
  enabling this feature will give a better performance.


Changes in version 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed name from LTE 3D Engine to LTE Game Engine

- Added support for Mipmapped textures. Mipmapping gives an high speed improvement.
  By default all textures are mipmapped, you can disable this feature with
  driver->setTextureCreationFlag(video::ETCF_CREATE_MIP_MAPS, false);

- Clipping comes necessary when your meshes has big triangles, but for model and object
  meshes (like the character) this is not necessary. By default now clipping is not
  enabled by default: if you need the engine to clip your mesh type
  node->setMaterialFlag(video::EMF_CLIPPING, true);

- Mesh triangle subdivision: Now it's possible to subidive the triangles of your meshes
  wich sides are greater than a value. You can do this using the Mesh Manipulator:
  SceneManager->getMeshManipulator()->subdivideTriangles(YourMesh, MaxSideSize)

- Added support for rendering into textures. This feature is very common, and the
  engine now can do it. Look at the RenderToTexture example for further information.

- Multitexturing is now supported. This feature is limited because it doesn't support
  multi texture coordinates, and it takes one more rendering pass (PSP GPU doesn't support
  one-pass multi texturing). Look at the SpecialFX example for further information.

- Added Sphere mapping: this effect is now supported. To enable sphere mapping for your
  scene node type node->setMaterialType(video::EMT_SPHERE_MAP).

- Added B3D Mesh support with full bone animator.

- Added celshading effect for your IAnimatedMeshSceneNode. To enable this feature for your
  scene node simply do: node->addCelshadingSceneNode(). Look at the documentation for
  further information.

- Added support for Dynamic Shadows. Look at the Dynamic Shadow example for further 
  information.

- Added ATRAC3 Audio support. Note that you can set position, get position, get duration,
  only for mp3 audio files.

- Now the File Browser sort the list pushing the folder on the top of the list.

- The speed of the mouse cursor is proportional to the current frame rate, this allows
  to use the cursor also at lower framerate.

- General speed improvement

- A Lot of Bug fixes

- Changed the intro logo screen and music effect

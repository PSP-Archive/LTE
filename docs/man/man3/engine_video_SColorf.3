.PP 
Class representing a color with four floats. 

The color values for red, green, blue and alpha are each stored in a 32 bit floating point variable. So all four values may be between 0.0f and 1.0f. This class is used rarely used by the engine Engine to specify a color. An other, faster way is using the class Color, which stores the color values in a single 32 bit integer.

/*
This tutorial shows how to use the built in User Interface of
the engine. It will give a brief overview and show
how to create and use windows, buttons, scroll bars, static 
texts and list boxes.

As always, we include the header files, and use the engine
namespaces. We also store a pointer to the engine device,
a counter variable for changing the creation position of a window,
and a pointer to a listbox.

The Event Receiver is not only capable of getting keyboard and
mouse input events, but also events of the graphical user interface 
(gui). There are events for almost everything: Button click, 
Listbox selection change, events that say that a element was hovered
and so on. To be able to react to some of these events, we create 
an event receiver. 
We only react to gui events, and if it's such an event, we get the
id of the caller (the gui element which caused the event) and get 
the pointer to the gui environment.
